The repository contains the official implementation of Light4Mars.

The article is currently being submitted to the journal ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

The dataset used in the paper is called [**SynMars-TW**](https://github.com/CVIR-Lab/SynMars/tree/SynMars-TW), which is an open source unstructured environmental fine-grained synthetic dataset based on real data from the TianWen-1 mission.

Light4Mars is on [**MMSegmentation**](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation).
