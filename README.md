# Light4Mars：A Lightweight Transformer Model for Semantic Segmentation on Unstructured Environment Like Mars

The repository contains the official implementation of Light4Mars model, published in:

Xiong, Y., Xiao, X., Yao, M., Cui, H., & Fu, Y. (2024). Light4Mars: A lightweight transformer model for semantic segmentation on unstructured environment like Mars. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, 214, 167-178. 

The dataset used in the paper is called [**SynMars-TW**](https://github.com/CVIR-Lab/SynMars/tree/SynMars-TW), which is an open source unstructured environmental fine-grained synthetic dataset based on real data from the TianWen-1 mission.

Light4Mars is on [**MMSegmentation**](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation).
